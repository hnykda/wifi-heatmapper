# FAQ

1. **How can I create a floor plan for my home?**  
   If you have one, upload an existing floor plan for your home.
   You can also use Google Maps, and take a screenshot of your home.
   make a sketch on paper.
   Use your phone or laptop to photograph the image, then upload it.

   Heat maps are inherently approximate, so the floor plan doesn't
   need to be perfect or "to scale".
   Just make it reasonably close, upload it, and
   start clicking on the **Floor Plan** tab.

2. **Why do I see `<redacted>`or `000000000000` instead of
  an SSID or address?**  
   Apple has changed the security mechanism in macOS 15 and later.
   Even with sudo access, the SSID and BSSID are no longer available.
   It appears that a macOS application now needs Location Access
   permissions to obtain this information.
